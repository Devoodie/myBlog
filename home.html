                <p>Hey, I'm Devante, an asipiring devops engineer and computer scientist.
                I'm currently sysops, but my passion is in both operations and development.
                Most of my free-time is spent running my own server (you're using it right now :D), working on my projects/GitHub,
                and playing some good old video games ;P. When I work, my preferred languages are Go, Python,
                and good old English ;P. Of course, there are more languages that I use like JavaScript,
                but the former languages listed burn the most fire in my loins.
                </p>

                my future projects I will keep strong documentation on my deliberation, research, and implementation. Every so often
                there may be an off-topic post, but the focus of this site will be computer science with a DevOps focus. <br>
                Disclaimer: I am not associated with any of the companys or projects in the image to thr right.
                These are only technologies I think are cool and am interested in working with.
